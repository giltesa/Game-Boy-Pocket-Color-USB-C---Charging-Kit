# Game Boy Pocket/Color: USB-C Charging Kit (GB2)

The **Game Boy Pocket/Color: USB-C Charging Kit**, or **GB2** as I like to call it, is a circuit that replaces the original power board of the **Game Boy Pocket** and **Game Boy Color**.

This circuit is a **multi-device** and versatile board with **multiple installation options**. This means that **this kit can be used for both Game Boy models**, and you can decide whether you want to **power your console with AA/AAA** batteries **or a rechargeable li-ion battery**. You can also choose between using the **original 2.5mm DC power connector** **or replacing it with a USB-C**. Additionally, you have **the option to install a light board that will indicate the status of the console and battery**, all from the original hole on the console, next to the screen.

### FEATURES

*   Exact **shape for Game Boy Pocket & Game Boy Color**.
*   **Power DC converter** of **5V** output.Â **(1)**
*   **External power** through **2.5mm DC jack** or **USB-C.** **(2)**
*   **Li-Ion battery charger** with overvoltage and undervoltage protection. **(2)**
*   **Safe charge and play**.
*   **Integrated LED indicators** on the main board, next to the battery connector for charging battery (red) and full battery (green). It can be disabled by the jumper SJ1.
*   **External LED indicators** board for playing (white), charging battery (red) and full battery (green). Optional installation.

**(1)** Provides stable power to your Game Boy, IPS screen, and flash card. However, it doesn't supply the -19v rail, which means the stock screen or GBP IPS screen, which adjusts brightness through the contrast wheel, will not be able to change the brightness level and will remain at its maximum level.

**(2)** The USB-C and li-ion battery require trimming of the shell. Please refer to the PDF installation manual for more information.
